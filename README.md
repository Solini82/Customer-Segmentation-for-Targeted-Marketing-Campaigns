## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values and removed canceled orders.
   - Created new features like `TotalSpend`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed customer distribution by country, top products, and total spend.

3. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Used **RFM analysis** to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
   - Applied **K-Means clustering** to group customers into segments.

4. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Built a **Random Forest model** to predict customer churn.

5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):**
   - Calculated CLV for each customer segment.

## Key Insights
1. **Customer Segments:**
   - Identified key segments such as **Champions**, **Loyal Customers**, **Potential Loyalists**, and **At Risk**.
   - High-value segments (e.g., **551 Segment**) contribute significantly to revenue.

2. **Churn Prediction:**
   - The Random Forest model achieved **perfect accuracy** (1.00) in predicting churn.
   - **Recency** and **Frequency** are the most important factors in predicting churn.

3. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):**
   - The **551 Segment** has the highest CLV (**$1,765,910**), making it the most valuable customer group.

4. **Actionable Recommendations:**
   - Proposed targeted marketing strategies for each segment to improve engagement and retention.
